Project Summary
This project involved creating and enhancing a Tkinter-based console chat application (console_chat.py) that interacts with the Ollama API for chatbot functionality. The application features a sliding console window with a customizable appearance, a chat area for user and chatbot messages, and an animated GIF (a dancing robot) displayed in a separate window. Over the course of the project, we implemented several key features and improvements:
Core Functionality:
Built a console that slides in/out from a configurable edge of the screen (top, bottom, left, or right) when toggled with the ~ key.

Integrated with the Ollama API to send user messages and display responses in the chat area.

Added a separate animation window displaying a dancing robot GIF that animates while the chatbot is processing or responding.

Customization and Configuration:
Added a /config command to open a configuration window where users can customize settings like window size, font, colors, animation settings, and more.

Implemented a theme system with multiple predefined themes (default, midnight_blue, slate_gray, forest_shadow) and the ability to save custom themes using /save_theme.

Allowed users to configure the animation window's transparency, size, and background color.

Animation Enhancements:
Made the animation window's background transparent, ensuring only the dancing robot GIF is visible (if the GIF itself has a transparent background).

Added the ability to enable/disable the animation via a checkbox in the /config menu, with immediate effect on visibility.

Added a custom field in the /config menu to specify the path to a transparent GIF file, with validation to ensure the file exists and is a .gif.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:
Fixed the "Enable Animation" checkbox functionality to properly show/hide the animation window when toggled.

Ensured the animation only appears when the console is visible and the animation is enabled.

Added detailed comments to every line of code for clarity and maintainability.

The final script is a fully functional, customizable chat console with a visually engaging animation feature, suitable for interacting with the Ollama chatbot in a user-friendly way.
