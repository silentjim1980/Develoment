# Develoment
Projects developed with xAI, chatGPT

Any projects found here are free to expand upon. I've taken or developed them as far as I wanted to for my purposes.
If anyone wants to expand their features, fork it, whatever, have at it & have fun.

These projects were either primarily developed completely with xAI or chatGPT & were just ideas that I had & wanted to see
what, if anything AI could do to help them get from an idea into reality.

These projects were again developed with xAI @Grok or chatGPT & python.
So the requirements would be one of those 2, your mind & flavor of coding you do, & python.

I'm not a coder, I don't use Github a lot, and I don't know the "etiquette". I'm just sharing my ideas & projects that I've
created. It's upon you the user to deduce or figure out how my projects work, because I didn't exactly document the entire process
& don't remember certain steps/requirements & because I didn't intend to release them but changed my mind.
