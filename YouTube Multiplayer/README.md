YouTube Data API v3
The YouTube Data API v3 is an API that provides access to YouTube data, such as videos, playlists, and channels.

I just wanted my own personal way to watch multiple YouTube videos, and live streams. This plays or arranges the videos in a way
that I want. Numerous streams and videos can be played at once. As you add videos the player will shrink to accommodate the new
videos. I've tested up to 28 videos playing at once.
